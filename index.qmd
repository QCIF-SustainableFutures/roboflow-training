# Module 2: Understanding the computer vision workflow
## Key Steps *‚ú®<span style="color:purple;">with the Roboflow sparkle</span>‚ú®*
- Objective and infrastructure
- Data collection and pre-processing
- <span style="color:purple;">Create account and project</span>
- Data splitting
- <span style="color:purple;">Data upload</span>
- <span style="color:purple;">Data annotation</span>
- <span style="color:purple;">Building your model development dataset</span>
- <span style="color:purple;">Model training</span>
- <span style="color:purple;">Model evaluation</span>
- <span style="color:purple;">Model inference</span> 
- Post-processing

## Objective and Infrastructure
- **Objective**: Define the problem you want to solve (e.g., species identification, behavior analysis)
  - How many classes?
  - What is the expected accuracy?
  - What is the long-term goal? 
- **Infrastructure**: Determine the hardware and software requirements for your project
  - GPU/CPU requirements
  - Storage capacity

## ü™úData collection and pre-processing
- **Data Collection**: Camera traps
- **Data Pre-processing**: Cleaning and preparing data for further analysis
  - Rename files 
  - Move files to appropriate folders

## <span style="color:purple;"> ü™úCreate account and project</span>
- Let's go to Roboflow!
- Create a Roboflow account
- Create a new project
  - Project name
  - Project type (remember the different computer vision tasks)
  - Project visibility (public or private)
  - License (e.g., CC-BY, CC-BY-NC)

::: {.callout-important}
Roboflow is free to use, but has some limitations. Private projects are only available for paid users.
:::


## ü™ú Data Splitting Part 1
- Now we need data to add into our project
  - Model development dataset (e.g., training, validation, evaluation)
  - Inference dataset

::: {.callout-note}
Depending on the dataset size, the model development dataset can be between 10-20% of the entire dataset.
:::

## Data Splitting Part 2 : Broad types of data selection
- Computer vision researchers -> Random selection
- Env computer vision researchers -> Targeted selection

::: {.callout-important}
The data splitting process is crucial and takes time. 
::: 

::: {.callout-important}
The model development dataset should be representative of the data that will be processed in the field / future. Variability is key.
:::

## Data Splitting Part 3: Importance of metadata

Metadata is crucial for understanding the context of the images and ensuring that the model is trained on relevant data.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
- Model trained on images from üèñÔ∏è will not be accurate when deployed in üèûÔ∏è
:::
::: {.column width="33%"}
- Model trained on images collected during ‚òÄÔ∏è hours will not be accurate when processing images collected at üåù
:::
::: {.column width="33%"}
- For a single location, a model trained on images collected in `year 1` will not be *accurate* when processing images collected in `year 2`
:::
::::

## Data Splitting Part 4: Relationship between objectives - metadata and data splitting
- This is why its important to determine your objectives at the beginning of the project 
- Questions that require answers?
  - How many classes?
  - How many ecosystems / locations?
  - How many seasons / years?

## Data Splitting Part 4: Relationship between objectives - metadata and data splitting
- 20 classes
- 3 ecosystems
- 2 seasons

::: {.callout-note}
Let's use a conservative 1,500 images **per class**
:::
```markdown
| Ecosystem   | Year 1 | Year 2 | Total |
|-------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Ecosystem 1 | 250    | 250    | 500   |
| Ecosystem 2 | 250    | 250    | 500   |
| Ecosystem 3 | 250    | 250    | 500   |
| Total       | 750    | 750    | 1,500 |
```

## Data Splitting Part 5: How many images do I need?
![](assets/medium_guidelines_modeldevelopment.png){width=30%}

<span style="font-size:small;">https://joelnadarai.medium.com/the-art-of-choosing-the-right-number-of-images-for-your-computer-vision-project-6e45efd1efbf#:~:text=For%20fine%2Dtuning%20pre%2Dtrained,per%20class%20for%20detection%20tasks.</span> 

In my experience, there is no *magic* number. 

## Data Splitting Part 6: What to do with class imbalance?
- **Class imbalance**: When one class has significantly more images than another
- **Solutions**:
  - Merging classes
  - Data augmentation
  - Data filtering
  - Data collection

## Data Splitting Part 7: Class imbalance example

```markdown
| Class         | Number of Images | Notes                             |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Kangaroo      | 1,200            | Overrepresented                   |
| Skink         | 300              | Underrepresented                  |
| Emu           | 150              | Severely underrepresented         |
| Wombat        | 800              | Moderately represented            |
| Possum        | 100              | Severely underrepresented         |
| Dingo         | 600              | Balanced                          |
| Echidna       | 50               | Rarely detected                   |
| Cockatoo      | 1,000            | Overrepresented                   |
| Platypus      | 20               | Extremely rare                    |
| Wallaby       | 700              | Balanced                          |

## ü™ú Data upload part 1

Lets use the `sample_camera_trap_images` dataset as an example

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- <span style="color:purple;">Upload images to Roboflow</span>
   - Batch Name üóíÔ∏è 
    - Use a name that makes sense for later filtering
   - Tags üè∑Ô∏è
    - Use tags that can help break down the data (e.g., ecosystem, year, season)
- Similar images from Object365
    - üí° Be careful with the license and introducing unwanted bias
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Upload images to Roboflow (Python SDK)

```{.python}
from roboflow import Roboflow

# Initialize the Roboflow object with your API key
rf = Roboflow(api_key="YOUR_PRIVATE_API_KEY")

# Project:https://app.roboflow.com/my-workspace/my-project
workspaceId = 'my-workspace'
projectId = 'my-project'
project = rf.workspace(workspaceId).project(projectId)

# Upload the image to your project
project.upload("UPLOAD_IMAGE.jpg")
```
:::
::::

## Data upload part 2
::: {.callout-tip}
Upload images in batches that make sense for your project. **My tip**: upload images based on initial data splitting. 
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
Always keep an eye on your Roboflow limits.
::: 

## Data upload part 3
- Roboflow also has Roboflow Universe 
  - A collection of datasets and models that can be used for training and evaluation
  - Can be used to augment your dataset
  - For WildObs: The best version of what a tagged image repository should look like
- Lets go to this link https://universe.roboflow.com/vijay-vikas-mangena/ostrich_cocotodarknet 
  - This will create a new project

## ü™ú Data annotation part 1
![Annotation types](assets/annotation_types.png)

## Data annotation part 2
- <span style="color:purple;">Labelling images in Roboflow</span>
  - Auto Label
    - Grounding DINO
    - My Models (e.g., MegaDetector or SpeciesNet)
        - Roboflow trained models
        - Upload via API ‚≠êÔ∏è

:::{.callout-tip}
Label every relevant object in every image, even if it‚Äôs partially visible - Roboflow
:::

:::{.callout-important}
You can always import labels from other tools / models / projects for images into Roboflow
:::


## ü™ú Building your model development dataset
- **Training**: Used to train the model - 70% of model development data
- **Validation**: Used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting - 10% of model development data
- **Evaluation**: Used to assess the model's performance on unseen data - 20% of data of model development

::: {.callout-tip}
**Reminder**: Upload images in batches that make sense for your project. **My tip**: upload images based on initial data splitting. 
:::

::: {.callout-note}
Sometimes researchers use a further 'test' dataset. A harder dataset to do a final query on the model's performance. 
:::

## Building your model development dataset - an example
Remember this is for 1 class

```{.markdown}
| Ecosystem   | Year 1 (Train) | Year 2 (Train) | Year 1 (Val) | Year 2 (Val) | Year 1 (Test) | Year 2 (Test) | Total |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Ecosystem 1 | 175            | 175            | 25           | 25           | 50            | 50            | 500   |
| Ecosystem 2 | 175            | 175            | 25           | 25           | 50            | 50            | 500   |

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Create a dataset version
  - Data augmentation
  - Data filtering
- Select a model architecture
  - Comments around RF-DETR
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Download the dataset version (Python)
```{.python}
from google.colab import userdata
from roboflow import Roboflow

ROBOFLOW_API_KEY = userdata.get('ROBOFLOW_API_KEY')

rf = Roboflow(api_key=ROBOFLOW_API_KEY)
project = rf.workspace("selencakmak").project("tumor-dj2a1")
version = project.version(1)
dataset = version.download("yolov8")
```
### Train the model (CLI)
```{.cli}
!yolo task=detect mode=train epochs=50 batch=32 plots=True \
model={HOME}/weights/yolov10n.pt \
data={dataset.location}/data.yaml
```
<span style="font-size:small;">I highly recommend you learn about batches and epochs</span>
:::
::::

## ü™úModel validation - evaluation
- Two different things
- **Validation**: Assess the model's performance on the validation set during training
  - Monitor metrics like loss and accuracy
  - Adjust hyperparameters to improve performance
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance on the evaluation set after training

## Model validation and evaluation - metrics
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall

## Understanding validation and evaluation results
- Lets review these outputs in Roboflow

::: {.callout-note}
We will not be able to cover how to review these metrics in a programmatic environment

## <span style="color:purple;">ü™úModel inference</span>
- **Inference**: The process of using a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data
- Let's use the Deployments tab in Roboflow to deploy our model

## ü™úPost-processing
- Not going to go in depth here
- Confidence threshold
- Non-max suppression
- Tracking

## Example of a computer vision output dataset

Below is an example of a classic computer vision (object detection) dataset structure:

```{.markdown}
| Filename     | Class      | xmin | xmax | ymin | ymax | Confidence |
|--------------|------------|------|------|------|------|------------|
| image1.jpg   | kangaroo   | 50   | 150  | 60   | 160  | 0.95       |
| image2.jpg   | possum     | 30   | 130  | 40   | 140  | 0.20       |
| image3.jpg   | bird       | 100  | 200  | 120  | 220  | 0.92       |
| image4.jpg   | cat        | 70   | 170  | 80   | 180  | 0.97       |
| image5.jpg   | dog        | 20   | 120  | 30   | 130  | 0.85       |
| image6.jpg   | bird       | 90   | 190  | 110  | 210  | 0.90       |
```

In most cases you will get results as a JSON file or individual txt files (for each image). You will spend some time doing data wrangling.
