This repository contains the resources for the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) and computer vision training to [WildObs Australia](https://wildobs.org.au/), [QCIF](https://www.qcif.edu.au/) and [DETSI](https://www.detsi.qld.gov.au/). 

The training was held on 2025-04-11 at UQ. 

The slides are available as .qmd in the file `index.qmd`. The slides were created in Quarto. The Quarto theme used in the slides was slightly modified from the original version that can be found [here](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean). 

The images used in the slides are available in the `assets` directory. The original images were created in Canva and screenshots were taken from the interface. 

The reason for this training was to provide a brief introduction to computer vision and Roboflow (as a tool to build computer vision models). 

The training covered the following topics:
- **Module 1**: AI, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision
- **Module 2**: Understanding the computer vision workflow
- **Module 3**: Building your model development dataset
- **Module 4**: Model training and evaluation
- **Module 5**: Model inference
- **Module 6**: Roboflow 'workflows'

A good dataset to practice with Roboflow is [here](https://universe.roboflow.com/vijay-vikas-mangena/ostrich_cocotodarknet). This dataset contains camera trap images of terrestrial animals.
